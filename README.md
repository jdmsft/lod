> This process can take up to 5 minutes. You can jump to the part 3 during this time. 

The update is done when the PowerShell console will automatically close by itself at the end of the process.

## 4. Connect to Azure

Open a new PowerShell console and use `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet with your credential (used during Azure Pass phase) to connect to your Azure Pass subscription!
